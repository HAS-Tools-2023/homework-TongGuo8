### Forecast:
| Forecast | Flow(cfs) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **one week** | **161.59** |
| **two week** | **170.02** |

1. A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.

 - The flow of Verde river has fluctuation which is one or two years have high streamflow and the next year the flow would decrease, and this year is a year of 'low' flow. According to the plot, the flow of this year since November has continuously increased, only 2021 had flow much lower than other years and 2019 had maximum flow during the same period, therefore I calculated the mean flow from 2016 to 2022.

 - Two week forecast used the same method, I plot the mean, max and min flow of November 26th to 30th and December 1st to 2nd, the figure showed that only 2019 had a extreme high flow, other years don't show much fluctuation in this period, even the maximun, minimum and average values are close to each other. I still calculated the flow of the year of 2016, 2017 and 2018 which has similar flow to get the two week forecast.  


2. A description of the dataset you added
  
  - I choose two datasets, one if the gage height of our forecast station and this data is from  [USGS Basin summary](https://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getwatershed?15060202/www/cgi-bin/lookup/getwatershed), and I access this data by using `url`. Another data is about precipitation of the site *09502960* and the data is from USGS as well, I use the same way to access the data by using `url`.
  
3. A plot of your additional time series along with your streamflow time series.

4. Reflections on any questions or uncertainties you have after this week. 
- I still feel a little confused about Thursday class, and that way to get accessed the data seems a little complex than using `url` of USGS. And when I tried to using the method of Thursday's class,it shows no such data in this site when I changing the varies, or I don't know how to get other site id...that's why my assignment mainly used the `url` from USGS to access different data.
