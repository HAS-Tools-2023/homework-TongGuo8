### Grade
3/3 - Great job this semester Tong! You have come so far and its really great to see how much you were able to accomplish. I'm very happy to hear that you found the class useful and I hope that you will keep coding as much as possible practice makes perfect :) 


1. What were your favorite (or most useful) topics we covered?
   
- My favorite part is pandas, maybe because it is more friendly and easy for me to slice data and the functions are also useful. And also matplotlib, this topic might be really useful for our own research to plot kinds of figures, I know using matplotlib can plot lots of amazing or more complicated figures, but for now I still only can plot some basic figures. 
     
2. What did we not cover that you wished we had gotten to?
   
- I know there are a lot of things in python, of course I hope I can learn more things in python I can use in my research, but I am not sure what packages or functions I need for it. And xrray seems to be a more powerful tool, but still feel confused about it. 
- You have taught us a lot as you can, I appreciate that! 
3. Are you happy with how far you have progressed over the course of the semester?

- Of course!! I started learning python with zero basis, I am glad I can learn so much about python. Before taking this class, I thought this might be a huge chanllenge for me to finish well, and for now, I'm glad to choose this class, it is fun and also full of challenges, but I enjoy it!

4. Any suggestions you have for next years class?
- Maybe the class exercises, I think we do have more class exercises in later content, this is useful to some extent (hope this is a useful advice), and you did reaally well in this class, I really enjoy your class,thank you again Laura!
