- note that you should submit your homework as a '.md' file for markdown. I added that extension to your submission for you.

### Assignment questions:
1. The types of flow, year, month, day are lists.
The lenth of them is 12668.
The data types of flow is float, year month and day are int.
2. The times that daily flow greater than my prediction are 891, and the total days in September are 1028, therefore the percentage is 86.67%.
3. The prediction would be larger if only considered the daily discharger before or in 2000.
The times that daily flow greater than my prediction before 2000 are 342, the total days in September are 360, and the percentage is 95%.
The times that daily flow greater than my prediction after 2010 are 317,the total days in September after 2010 are 397, the percentage is 79.85%.
4. In the first halp flow of September, the daily flow decreases gradually, and in the beginning of second half, the daily flow uauslly increases and larger than the last few days in first half, and then the daily flow also shows the decreasing trend.  

### Reason: 
After calculating the average flow in September after 2020, I found that the average flow in Septembr 2021 is is relatively close to the average calculated based on the existing flow data in September 2023, therefore I calculated the average flow from 2021-09-12 to 2021-09-18 as the one week forecast, and the mean flow from 2021-09-19 to 2021-09-25 as the second week forecasing.
